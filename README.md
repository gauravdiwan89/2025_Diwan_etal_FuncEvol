# 2025_Diwan_etal_FuncEvol

In this repository, we have supplied the scripts that re-create all figures in the manuscript. All steps starting from the data in our PostgreSQL database or from intermediary files in the `data` folder.

Users can download the database (called `orthologs_pub`) from this page - https://russelllab.org/funcevol/
They will need to decompress the file and then use `pg_restore` command from Postgres software.

For questions, please create an issue or email me at gaurav.diwan@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de
